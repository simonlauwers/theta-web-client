## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a micro-service of a bigger 3D Risk-game application. This project was imported from Gitlab where all our micro-service-repositories live.
This repository is a collaborative work mainly between me and 2 other full stack students. You can find their github profiles in the contributors tab.


## Technologies
### Three.js
We used Three.js to show a 3D map to the players. We thought that it would be a great addition to implement an intuitive 3D map that is soothing to the eye.
And it was not so difficult to figure out how to use this library, so we thought that it was a must to implement this feature.

### React
We used the React framework in combination with Typescript, the UI library "Material UI" and other extra libraries to achieve our results.
A useful UI is the first thing that attracts a player, and it has to be unique in color, pattern, shape, and font. We did our best to take all this in account, and we were all happy with the outcome.
