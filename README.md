# Thèta Web Client

This repository contains the front-end. It is almost completely created using React in TypeScript.

## Introduction

We, at Thèta, are proud developers of our very first multiplayer game. We've developed an online version of the popular game "Risk", using microservices, 3D technologies and much more.
 
We've reached a total of 5 services, which are:
- Ai service
- Analytics service
- Chat service
- Game service
- User service

Besides that, there is the web client written in React and an admin panel written in Vue.

This was a fun and educational experience for everyone here at Thèta. 
We couldn't have made this possible without the help of our coaches:
- Bart Vochten
- Herwig De Smet
- Geert De Paepe
- Jan Van Overveldt

### Technologies

## Three.js

We used Three.js to show a 3D map to the players. We thought that it would be a great addition to implement an intuitive 3D map that is soothing to the eye.
And it was not so difficult to figure out how to use this library, so we thought that it was a must to implement this feature.

## React

We used the React framework in combination with Typescript, the UI library "Material UI" and other extra libraries to achieve our results.
A useful UI is the first thing that attracts a player, and it has to be unique in color, pattern, shape, and font. We did our best to take all this in account, and we were all happy with the outcome.
